## About the Code

The Purpose of this Microcontroller Code is to generate Sensor Sate from the SOnsors COnnected to to give an Alarm when the Air Quality is bad. For this reason, the SGP30 Sensor Module measure eCO2 and TVOC in the breathing Air. The BME280 Barometric Sensor is required to calibrate the SGP30, and therefore to enhance its accuracy.
