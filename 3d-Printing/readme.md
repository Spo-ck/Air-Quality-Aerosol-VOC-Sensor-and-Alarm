The Sensor PCB Case consists out of 3 parts, a body frame, a front and a bottom part. For the Assembly, the Soldered PCB is first fittet into the Body Frame from the bottom so that the case mathes the pin header exactly. The Sensor cable is the placed into the small hole on the top side of the frame. After that, the Front and Bottom Party are crewed to the case. The Screwd sensor case it then first plugged into the Pin Header of the M5StickC. After that, the Sensor Cable is plugged into the Grove Connecter.
